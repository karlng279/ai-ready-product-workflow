**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Listing Detail Page has a "Buy Now" button (for fixed-price items).
- **AC-002:** Displays total price including estimated fees (if any).
- **AC-003:** Purchase Confirmation Modal/Page with "Confirm Purchase" button.

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-004:** Clicking "Buy Now" opens the confirmation flow.
- **AC-005:** After confirmation, button state changes to "Processing...".
- **AC-006:** Success page displays Order ID and Seller Contact Information for offline settlement.

---

## Logic

- **AC-007:** Item status changes to "Sold" immediately upon confirmation.
- **AC-008:** Prevents double-booking (locking mechanism required if two users try to buy simultaneously).

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-009:** MVP does not process online payment; it simply records the intent and reserves the item.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Processing to "Sold" state must happen within 2 seconds.
