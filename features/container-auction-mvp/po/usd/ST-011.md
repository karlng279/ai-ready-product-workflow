# ST-011: Acceptance Criteria

**Story:** Admin manages users
**USL Reference:** [ST-011 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-011-admin-manages-users)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

---

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Admin Dashboard "User Management" tab.
- **AC-002:** User list table with columns: Name, Email, Role, Status, Registration Date.
- **AC-003:** Filter by Role (Carrier, SME, Repair) and Status (Active, Suspended).
- **AC-004:** Actions: "Approve" (for new requests), "Suspend", "Reactivate".

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-005:** Suspending a user shows a confirmation dialog requiring a reason.
- **AC-006:** Approved users receive an email notification.

---

## Logic

- **AC-007:** Suspended users cannot log in.
- **AC-008:** New Entity registrations (Carriers/Repair shops) require manual approval (status = pending).
- **AC-009:** Individual users (SMEs) may auto-approve depending on config (currently Manual for safety).

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-010:** Admin role is seeded in the system and cannot be suspended.
