**USL Reference:** [ST-002 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-002-seller-creates-container-auction)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** The "Create Auction" page must have fields for: Title, Description, Quantity, Starting Bid, Reserve Price (Optional), Location, Condition.
- **AC-002:** A "Duration" selector (3 days, 7 days, 14 days) must be present.
- **AC-003:** An image upload section.
- **AC-004:** A "Start Auction" button.

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-005:** Clicking "Start Auction" triggers specific validation for auction fields.
- **AC-006:** User must confirm the auction start, as auctions cannot be edited once bids are placed.
- **AC-007:** Success message redirects to the active auction page.

---

## Logic

- **AC-008:** Starting Bid must be greater than 0.
- **AC-009:** Reserve Price, if set, must be greater than or equal to Starting Bid.
- **AC-010:** Auction End Date is calculated based on selected duration from the moment of publication.

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-011:** Sellers cannot bid on their own auctions.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Auction creation transaction must be atomic to prevent data inconsistency.
