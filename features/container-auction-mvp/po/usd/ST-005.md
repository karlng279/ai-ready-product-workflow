**Story:** Buyer places bid on auction
**USL Reference:** [ST-005 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-005-buyer-places-bid-on-auction)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** Auction Detail Page displays "Current Bid", "Time Remaining", and "Bid Input" field.
- **AC-002:** "Place Bid" button.
- **AC-003:** "Bid History" list showing recent bids (anonymized users).

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-004:** Details update in (near) real-time to show new bids from others.
- **AC-005:** Placing a bid shows a confirmation dialog.
- **AC-006:** Success state shows "You are the highest bidder".
- **AC-007:** Error state shows "Bid too low" if another bid came in higher.

---

## Logic

- **AC-008:** New bid must be > Current Highest Bid + Minimum Increment.
- **AC-009:** User cannot bid if auction time has expired.
- **AC-010:** User cannot bid if they are the seller (Self-bidding protection).

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-011:** Countdown timer must handle timezone differences correctly (show relative time).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** Bid processing latency < 1s.
