**USL Reference:** [ST-003 in usl.md](../usl.md#st-003-seller-manages-active-listings)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03

## UI Elements

- **AC-001:** "My Listings" page displays a table/list of all active Sales and Auctions.
- **AC-002:** Columns included: Title, type (Sale/Auction), Price/Current Bid, Status, Actions.
- **AC-003:** Action buttons: "Edit", "Delete" (for Sales), "View" (for Auctions).

---

## UI Behavior

- **AC-004:** Clicking "Edit" navigates to the edit page for that item.
- **AC-005:** Clicking "Delete" shows a confirmation modal.
- **AC-006:** Auctions with active bids cannot be deleted, only "Cancelled" with a reason.

---

## Logic

- **AC-007:** Only items created by the logged-in user are visible.
- **AC-008:** Deleted items are soft-deleted (status = archived).

---

## Special Notes

- **AC-009:** Pagination required if items > 20.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001:** List loads within 1.5 seconds.
